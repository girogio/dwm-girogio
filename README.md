# dwm-grongo

## Description
Inspired by [Juan](https://github.com/JuanScerriE), I have been converted into using TWM's, the most superior one being [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/). This is the my running release build for my own purple themed dwm.

## Remarks
A release will never follow any commit of mine, as if one is to start using dwm, they should know how to compile it. Due to the absence of external config files which are usually loaded at startup, to modify the window manager, one must edit the code directly and thus keep the usage of dwm an _elitist_ one.
